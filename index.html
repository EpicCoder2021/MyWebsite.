        <h2>Playing sports</h2>
      <p>I love to play soccer and baseball because I find them both fun and interesting. I like both of the sports because they both involve a lot of running. Baseball is fun because you get a lot of adrenaline playing it and it is exciting. Soccer is fun because your running all the time and have to do tricks and moves to get goals. </p>
        <h2>I like to read</h2>
        <p>I like to read books about wars and adventure and action. War books are more of my preference because I like to learn history. My favorite type of war is world war two. I also like to read abou the Apollo missions.</p>
